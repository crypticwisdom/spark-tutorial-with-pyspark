# **Recommended Learning Path (PySpark + Spark in Jupyter)**

---

### **Spark and PySpark Fundamentals**

- [x]  **What is Apache Spark? What is PySpark?**
- [x] **Why Spark? (Intro)**
  - [x] **Spark Modules**
  - [x] **Batch vs Streaming**
- [x]  **Apache Spark‚Äôs Architecture:** Driver, Executors, Cluster Manager
- [x] **Lifecycle of a Spark Job**
- [x] **Core Spark Abstractions (RDD, Dataframe and Dataset)**
  *(DataFrames are primary in PySpark)*
- [x] **Spark Contexts (SparkSession, SparkContext, SQLContext, HiveContext)**
- **Execution Modes (‚úÖ This decides where Spark runs and who manages the resources.) (Local, Standalone, YARN, Kubernetes)**
- [x] **Deployment Modes (‚úÖ This determines where the driver lives and how it talks to the executors.)** (Local, Client, Cluster)

### CODE: The Basics (with Examples in Jupyter)**

- [x]  **Starting a SparkSession**
- [x]  **Creating DataFrames from Python objects, CSV, and Parquet**
- [ ] **Basic DataFrame Operations:**
  - [x] `select`, `filter`, `where`
  - [x] `withColumn`, `drop`, `distinct`
  - [ ] Sorting: `orderBy`, `sort`
- [ ] **Data Types and Schemas**
- [x] **Handling Missing Data (`dropna`, `fillna`)**

- **Intermediate Data Operations**
  - [ ] **Aggregations and GroupBy**
  - [ ] **Joins (inner, left, right, outer)**
  - [ ] **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**
  - [ ] **Null handling, type casting, string functions**

- **SQL with Spark**
  - [ ] **Registering DataFrames as Temp Views**
  - [ ] **Running SQL Queries with `spark.sql()`**

- **Data Ingestion and Output**
  - [ ] **Reading/Writing CSV, JSON, Parquet, Delta**
  - [ ] **Partitioned and Bucketed Writes**
  - [ ] **Intro to external storage (S3/MinIO, HDFS)**

### Spark Execution and DAGs

- [x] **What is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)?**
- [x] **What happens when you call an action?**
- [x] **Spark UI: Jobs, Stages, and Tasks**
- [x] **Understanding Spark Execution Flow**
- [x] **Wide vs Narrow Transformations**
- [ ] **Monitoring and Debugging**: Spark UI, Reading DAG, Reading Query Plans

### Optimization and Performance Tuning

‚úÖ **Understand the terms first:**

- [ ] **Spark Configuration** ‚Üí Settings that control Spark's behavior; key-value.
- [ ] **Spark Configuration Tuning** ‚Üí Adjusting configs (e.g., memory, cores)
- [ ] **Spark Tuning** ‚Üí Adjusting partitioning, shuffles, executors
- [ ] **Spark Optimization** ‚Üí Writing efficient code (e.g., avoid UDFs, use `select`)
- [ ] **Performance Tuning** ‚Üí All of the above + UI analysis
- [ ] **Best Practices for PySpark in Production**

üîß **Optimization Techniques:**

- [ ] Use optimized formats: Parquet, Delta
- [ ] Partition/Coalesce wisely
- [ ] Cache/Persist data when reused
- [ ] Avoid UDFs unless necessary
- [ ] Use broadcast joins carefully
- [ ] Reduce shuffle with good key distribution
- [ ] Tune configs: memory, cores, partitions
- [ ] Understand Spark UI and troubleshoot slow jobs
- [ ] Leverage AQE (Adaptive Query Execution)
- [ ] Optimize cluster resources

---

### Advanced Topics (Optional but Powerful)

- [ ] **Window Functions**
- [ ] **Spark Streaming (Structured Streaming)**
- [ ] **Working with Big Data at scale**
- [ ] **Using Spark with MLlib (for machine learning)**
- [ ] **Delta Lake, Iceberg (modern data lake formats)**
- [ ] **Deploying Spark apps (K8s, YARN)**

## üß† Learning Strategy

- Use **Jupyter notebooks or Databricks notebooks**
- **Tweak code and experiment after each example**
- Add markdown comments like ‚Äú# filter example‚Äù to reinforce learning
- Follow **Spark UI** alongside your runs to understand what happens
- Study slow runs ‚Üí optimize ‚Üí compare
